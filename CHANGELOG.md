# Version 1.0.0

* Public release
* `[BREAKING CHANGE]` `id` field is removed from widget meta in favor of `name` field (as `id` is autogenerated after every update and unfit for widget-based business logic). All corresponding `widgetId` properties should be replaced with `widgetName` field.
* `View` and `DashboardLayout` no longer require `skipWidgetTypes` property, empty array is provided when missing for `DashboardLayout`.
